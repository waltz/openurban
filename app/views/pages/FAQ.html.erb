<h2>Who can contribute to OpenUrban?</h2>
<p>Anyone.</p><br>


<h2>What kind of content can I put on OpenUrban?</h2>
<p>Content on OpenUrban is focused on current and proposed urban development. (<a href="#">See Guidelines</a>).</p><br>

<h2>Why isn't there any content in my city?</h2>
<p>Because no one has entered any yet - you can be the first person! Create an account or log in to map and write a short article about a project in your city. You don't have to know all the information, other people can help fill in the rest.</p> <br>

<h2>Is the site unbounded geographically?</h2>

<h2>How is content edited and reviewed?</h2>

Otherwise this is your space to share information and ideas with other people in your city and around the world.</p><br>

<h2>What if I see something that is wrong or inaccurate?</h2>
<p>If you see something wrong change it. This is the point of OpenUrban, everything is constantly updated - just like a city. However, do be careful if you are removing or altering something that has citation. Repeatedly deleting appropriate and accurately cited content will result in administrative actions being taken against the offender. Any disputes between users which cannot be resolved will be reviewed by administrators.</p><br>

<h2>Do you plan to pilot it in certain cities?</h2>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, we will not restrict the site to specific locations. However, we will focus on promoting the project in specific cities. For OpenUrban to work it's crucial that a city has a critical mass of contributors and information. We started in Istanbul and have had subsequent activity in Seattle and New York. If you think OpenUrban would be great in your city and you want to promote it, send us an email and we can help you organize.</p><br>
